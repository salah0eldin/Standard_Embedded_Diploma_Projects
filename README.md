## Projects
Here you will find a collection of projects developed during the Standard Embedded Diploma. Each project is designed to enhance your understanding of embedded systems and improve your practical skills.

### C Project: Student Management System
- **Description**: A console-based application to manage student records using C programming.
- **Features**: Add, delete, and update student records, search for students by ID, display all student records.

### Interfacing Project: Stopwatch using AVR ATmega32
- **Description**: A stopwatch implemented using the AVR ATmega32 microcontroller and simulated with Proteus.
- **Features**: Start, stop, and reset functionality, display time on a 7-segment display.

### Interfacing Project: Smart Home System
- **Description**: A smart home system implemented using AVR ATmega32 microcontroller.
- **Features**: Control lights, fans, and display system status on an LCD.

### Test ADC Negative
- **Description**: A project to test the ADC functionality with negative values.
- **Features**: Read and display ADC values, handle negative inputs.

## stdDrivers
!stdDrivers

The `stdDrivers` folder contains standard drivers used across various projects. These drivers are essential for interfacing with different hardware components and ensuring smooth operation of the embedded systems. The drivers include:

### MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)
- **ADC**: For analog-to-digital conversion.
- **GPIO**: For general-purpose input/output operations.
- **Timers**: For handling timer operations.

### ECU (Electronic Control Unit) Layer
- **Buzzer**: Module for controlling a buzzer.
- **DCMotor**: Module for controlling a DC motor.
- **FlameSensor**: Module for interfacing with a flame sensor.
- **Keypad**: Module for interfacing with a keypad.
- **LCD**: Module for interfacing with an LCD display.
- **LDR**: Module for interfacing with a light-dependent resistor.
- **LED**: Module for controlling LEDs.
- **LM35**: Module for interfacing with an LM35 temperature sensor.
- **SevenSegment**: Module for controlling a seven-segment display.

## Getting Started
